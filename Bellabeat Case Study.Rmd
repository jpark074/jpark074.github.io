##### Installing and Loading Packages

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse", quiet = T)
install.packages("skimr", quiet = T)
install.packages("janitor", quiet = T)
install.packages("dplyr", quiet = T)
install.packages("sqldf", quiet = T)
install.packages("reshape2", quiet = T)

library("tidyverse", quietly = T)
library("skimr", quietly = T)
library("janitor", quietly = T)
library("dplyr", quietly = T)
library("sqldf", quietly = T)
library("reshape2", quietly = T)
```

#### Importing Datasets

```{r, message=FALSE}
setwd("/Users/Jeong Park/OneDrive/Documents/Fitabase Data 2016.04.12 - 2016.05.12")
daily_Activity <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
daily_Calories <- read_csv("dailyCalories_merged.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
daily_Intensities <- read_csv("dailyIntensities_merged.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
daily_Steps <- read_csv("dailySteps_merged.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
sleep_Day <- read_csv("sleepDay_merged.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
weight_Loginfo <- read_csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

```

#### Observing the data

```{r}
head(daily_Activity)
glimpse(daily_Activity)


head(daily_Calories)
glimpse(daily_Calories)


head(daily_Intensities) 
glimpse(daily_Intensities)


head(daily_Steps)
glimpse(daily_Steps)


head(sleep_Day)
glimpse(sleep_Day)


head(weight_Loginfo)
glimpse(weight_Loginfo)
```

#### Cleaning the Data

##### Most of the columns are redundant, daily_Activity contains data for calories, intensities and steps. Therefore, it will be easier to analyze the data once the data frames are merged.

```{r}
daily_Activity <- daily_Activity %>%
  rename(Date = ActivityDate)

daily_Steps <- daily_Steps %>%
  rename(TotalSteps = StepTotal)

sleep_Day <- sleep_Day %>% rename(Date = SleepDay)

join_1 <- inner_join(daily_Activity, daily_Calories, by = c('Id', 'Calories'))
join_2 <- inner_join(daily_Activity, daily_Intensities)
join_3 <- inner_join(daily_Activity, daily_Steps)
join_4 <- inner_join(daily_Activity, sleep_Day)

merge_A <- merge(join_1, join_2)
merge_B <- merge(join_3, join_4)
daily_userData <- merge(merge_A, merge_B) %>% select(-ActivityDay)

head(daily_userData)

```

#### Check for NA values and see if they will have an affect on the analysis.

```{r}
cbind(lapply(lapply(daily_userData, is.na),sum))
sum(is.na(weight_Loginfo))

n_distinct(weight_Loginfo$Id)
nrow(weight_Loginfo)
```

##### weight_Loginfo has 65 missing values of the 68 rows in the Fat column. This data frame also has a very low number of participants, only 8. Therefore, it will be difficult to provide reliable recommendations through this data frame and will not be used in the analysis.

#### Analysis

##### Summarzing the data for analysis

```{r}
summarize(daily_userData)
```

##### Looking for trends in user data. Using sql to focus on the relationship between activity type and calories burned and sleep quality with activity type.

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT Id, Date, Calories, TotalSteps, TotalDistance, TrackerDistance, LoggedActivitiesDistance,
(VeryActiveDistance+ModeratelyActiveDistance+LightActiveDistance) AS TotalActivity, (VeryActiveMinutes+FairlyActiveMinutes+LightlyActiveMinutes)/60 AS TotalTimeActive

FROM daily_userData

WHERE TotalActivity <> 0 AND  TotalTimeActive <> 0')
```

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT Id,Date,Calories, TotalSleepRecords, TotalMinutesAsleep, TotalTimeInBed, TotalSteps, TotalDistance, TrackerDistance, LoggedActivitiesDistance, (VeryActiveDistance+ModeratelyActiveDistance+LightActiveDistance) AS TotalActivity, SedentaryActiveDistance, (VeryActiveMinutes+FairlyActiveMinutes+LightlyActiveMinutes)/60 AS TimeActive, SedentaryMinutes/60 AS TimeSedentary

FROM daily_userData')
```

#### Visualizations

##### The scatter plot below depicts a the relationship between minutes spent in each activity level and total daily calories burned. Overall we can see that very active minutes and calories burned have a positive relationship. This suggests that the more physical activity the participant did, the more calories they burned. This could also be seen with the fairly active minutes, but noticeably less so. Furthermore, the slope for the lightly active and sedentary active minutes is close to zero. Therefore, regardless of time, calories burned is most likely due to metabolism.

```{r}
daily_userData <- daily_userData %>% mutate(TimeVeryActive = VeryActiveMinutes/60,
                                            TimeFairlyActive = FairlyActiveMinutes/60,
                                            TimeLightlyActive = LightlyActiveMinutes/60,
                                            TimeSedentary = SedentaryMinutes/60)

Activitytime.gathered <- daily_userData %>% gather(key = 'variables', value = 'ActivityLevel',-Calories,-Id, -Date, -TotalSleepRecords, -TotalMinutesAsleep, -TotalTimeInBed, -TotalSteps, -TotalDistance, -TrackerDistance, -LoggedActivitiesDistance, -VeryActiveDistance, -ModeratelyActiveDistance,-LightActiveDistance, -SedentaryActiveDistance, -VeryActiveMinutes, -FairlyActiveMinutes, -LightlyActiveMinutes, -SedentaryMinutes)

head(Activitytime.gathered)

Activitytime.gathered <- Activitytime.gathered %>% 
mutate(across(variables, factor, levels = c('TimeVeryActive', 'TimeFairlyActive', 'TimeLightlyActive', 'TimeSedentary')))

ggplot(Activitytime.gathered, aes(x=ActivityLevel, y=Calories, color = ActivityLevel)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=lm) + facet_wrap(~variables, scale = 'free') +  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") + labs(title="Relationship Between Activity Level and Calories Burned") 

```

##### This figure shows the relationship between total steps taken and calories burned. There seems to be a positive relationship which reflects the expectation that if the participant took more steps they will burn more calories.

```{r}
ggplot(daily_userData, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories, color = TotalSteps)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=lm) + scale_color_gradient(low = "red", high = "purple") + labs(title ='Relationship between Total Steps and Calories Burned') +  theme(legend.position="none")
```

##### The scatterplot below shows the relationship between the time slept and minutes spent in each activity level. Overall for very, fairly and lightly active minutes the slopes are close to zero suggests that being active during the day allows one to get better quality sleep. Meanwhile the slope for total sleep and sedentary minutes is negative which suggests that the more one is sedentary the lower quality of sleep that they get.

```{r}
daily_userData <- daily_userData %>% mutate(TotalSleep = TotalMinutesAsleep/60)

Sleepquality.gathered <- daily_userData %>% gather(key = 'variables', value = 'ActivityLevel', -TotalSleep, -Id, -Date, -Calories, -TotalSleepRecords, -TotalMinutesAsleep, -TotalTimeInBed, -TotalSteps, -TotalDistance, -TrackerDistance, -LoggedActivitiesDistance, -VeryActiveDistance, -ModeratelyActiveDistance,-LightActiveDistance, -SedentaryActiveDistance, -VeryActiveMinutes, -FairlyActiveMinutes, -LightlyActiveMinutes, -SedentaryMinutes)

head(Sleepquality.gathered)

Sleepquality.gathered <- Sleepquality.gathered %>% 
  mutate(across(variables, factor, levels = c('TimeVeryActive', 'TimeFairlyActive', 'TimeLightlyActive', 'TimeSedentary')))

ggplot(Sleepquality.gathered, aes(x=ActivityLevel, y= TotalSleep, color = TotalSleep)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=lm) + facet_wrap(~variables, scale = 'free') + scale_color_gradient(low = "black", high = "yellow") + labs(title="Relationship Between Total Sleep and Activity Level")

```

#### Conclusion

From the analysis there are clear trends that gave interesting insights that could be applicable to the marketing strategy for Bellabeat in the global smart device market.

These insights were:

1)  There is a clear relation between higher physical activity and more calories burned.

2)  More activity is linked with higher quality of sleep.

#### Recommendation

1)  Recommend users to set goals for total amount of steps taken in a day. Enable notifications to encourage users to meet the goal and if they achieve it, to set a higher goal when they feel ready.

2)  Include a function in the Bellabeat app to alert users to try and get at least 30 minutes of moderate activity if data shows that they are often sedentary throughout the day.

3)  Have the app notify users with encouraging and motivating messages, especially if they have been sedentary for a extended period of time to motivate activity.

4)  Enhance the app to inform users of disruptive sleeping habits, such as irregular sleep schedules or not enough activity.
